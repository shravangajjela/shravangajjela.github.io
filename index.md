Hey there! Iâ€™m a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have previously interned at Facebook, Shopify, and TD. I'm familiar with Python, C++, and Ruby. I am currently interested in distributed systems and have also started delving into machine learning. 

I am looking for Fall 2020 internships and 2021 new grad positions!  Feel free to contact me on one of the platforms above or view my resume.

On a non-work related note, I enjoy hiking, reading, and everything space related.
