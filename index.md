Hey there, I am an incoming Software Engineer at Facebook NY! 

I studied Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and interned at Facebook, Shopify, and TD. I am particularly interested in distributed systems and am familiar with C++, Rust, and Python.

On a non-work-related note, I enjoy hiking, reading, and everything space-related. 

If you have any intriguing opportunities, please contact me on one of the platforms above or view my resume.
