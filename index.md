Hey there! Iâ€™m a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have previously interned at Facebook, Shopify, and TD. I'm familiar with C++, Java, and Python. I am particularly interested in distributed systems.

If you have any interesting oppurtunities, feel free to contact me on one of the platforms above or view my resume.

On a non-work related note, I enjoy hiking, reading, and everything space related.
